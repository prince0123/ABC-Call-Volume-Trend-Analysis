# ABC-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis

üîç **Project Overview:**



In the realm of CX analytics, understanding and optimizing customer interactions is crucial. For this project, I used a comprehensive dataset that included details such as agent names and IDs, queue times, call times, durations, and call statuses (abandoned, answered, transferred). My goal was to derive actionable insights to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.



üí° **Key Analyses & Insights:**



1. **Average Call Duration:** 

  - Calculated the average duration of incoming calls for each time bucket to identify peak periods and optimize resource allocation.



2. **Call Volume Analysis:**

  - Visualized the total number of calls received over time using graphs and charts, highlighting trends and identifying busy periods.



3. **Manpower Planning:**

  - Proposed a strategic plan to reduce the call abandon rate from 30% to 10% by optimizing agent allocation during peak hours.



4. **Night Shift Manpower Planning:**

  - Developed a manpower plan to ensure customer calls are answered throughout the night, maintaining a maximum abandon rate of 10%.



üîß **Data Analytics Tools Used:**

- **Python & Pandas:** For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.

- **SQL:** For querying and managing data.

- **Excel:** For final presentation and reporting.



üìà **Business Impact:**

- Enhanced understanding of call patterns and customer behavior.

- Improved customer satisfaction by reducing wait times and abandoned calls.

- Optimized agent scheduling, leading to more efficient operations.



This project was an incredible journey into the power of data analytics to drive strategic decisions and improve customer experiences. I‚Äôm passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems and create actionable insights.
